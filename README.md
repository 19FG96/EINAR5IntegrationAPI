# EINAR5Integration

## Introduction

This project is a simple API integration that demonstrates the consumption of the EINAR 5 API. It retrieves events from storage and displays them to authenticated users on the client side.
The project leverages the capabilities of the [HarbardSDK](https://github.com/adaptiverecognition/harbard-sdk) for its implementation.
